#Personal Health Record Data management System

Personal Health Records lets you easily catalog and share information about your health. 

* Store information in a secure, cloud server

* Discrete privacy controls for who sees which parts of your health record

* Easily update your family members or doctors about your health information

It is a Ruby on Rails web-app, and the goal is to provide an open API for other developers to utilize Tabby as a hub for connecting personal health data, from running miletimes to genomic analysis.
